A very accomplished and notable civil engineering firm in Phoenix was in need of a total upgrade to their current web presence.

Migrated business to Google Apps and built the custom app on Rails 2.3.4

The site was a complete redesign and re-worked so that Lemme Engineering could maintain all the content from a web interface. Functionality included the ability to add and remove photos, employee profiles, project summaries, frequently used links, authentication/authorization and an FTP GUI interface.

Lemme often collaborates with other companies on the large scale projects they take on. One of their business requirements was to provide a quicker way to share very large files. Since the files are too large for email, they were pleased to have an easy to use form for internal and external file sharing included on the site.

Lemme also took this opportunity to integrate their corporate identity into the social media arena with a Facebook profile and a Twitter account. We integrated the site to automatically post a new tweet with every new job posting or project listing.
