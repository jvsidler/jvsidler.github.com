I built an intranet site for a corporation's internal management of external website content. This application streamlined many of the daily tasks of updating, duplicating, adding and taking down content for a site that supported 13 countries and 5 languages.

It supported a role based login system that was manageable via an admin interface. Authors could publish content to a staging server and either migrate that update to the live servers themselves after admin approval or an admin could push the content directly themselves. This application was built to help the marketing department comply with PCI.
