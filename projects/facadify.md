This project has run its course and was discontinued on February 1st 2015. Thank you.

Façadify is a Rails 3.2.x application built for the [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/?ref=fivethrive) [app store](http://apps.shopify.com/?ref=fivethrive). Whats that? You've never heard of Shopify? For shame! If you want to sell anything online, please click on the green icon at the top of the page to get started with your free trial.

Façadify makes implementing [Google Content Experiments](https://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1745147&topic=1745207&rd=1) dead simple. Google got rid of Web Optimizer in 2012 and replaced it with Content Experiments which allows implementing A/B split testing for any page on a website. That just means you can test up to six different versions of any page to find out which version performs the best, according to your desired outcome.
