This was built as the face of a lead generation application for senior care. The app uses Medicare data and provides an easy to use interface for searching and contacting senior care facilities by zipcode search proximity.

Retirement Years was built in Rails 3.0, JQuery AJAX, HTML5 (HAML) and CSS 3 (SCSS). I was responsible for everything except the graphics. It is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and uses a PostgreSQL database.

The company merged with another and my position was eliminated before it progressed beyond its first phase.
