Edgar and Zackary is a children's adventure series based on a young boy and his guardian angel. This ecommerce solution interfaces with Paypal and instantly serve downloadable digital goods at the time of purchase. It is built in Rails 2.3.4 with Ruby 1.8.7 and runs on Passegner 2.2.5 and NGINX on an Ubuntu Linux server.

Built from the ground up, the site admin has the ability to maintain everything on the site from products in the store and order tracking to the cartoon videos that will become the backbone of the site.
