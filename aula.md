Hello Aula!
===========

I'm Jim Sidler, VP Engineering at Aula.

* * *

I know that is incredibly audacious but I know you are very busy and likely inundated with applications so hopefully that caught your attention. I have already applied to the position via remoteok.io but I haven't been able to shake the feeling that I am the perfect fit for the role and really want a chance to have a conversation. The top three reasons that I will help Aula excel are my ability to build and foster community, my deep technical background and my experience being remote.

Most recently my ability to build and foster community helped when my current employer saw attrition in the face of trying to grow the team at the same time. With what felt like a revolving door, I was able to build rapport and confidence in the engineering team that resulted in a handful of critical players deciding to stick around. Shortly after, the team participated in an engineering-wide personality test exercise where everyone took the DiSC test. I was the only one to get the 'i' result and everyone laughed because it clarified for everyone why I stood out as the obvious builder of the now collaborative community.

As for my technical background, I've always liked puzzles and brain teasers because I love to use my brain. This curious nature served me well as an engineer over the past 15 years, even as I have built a couple of community oriented software solutions myself! However, as I have been a part of teams that have come up with solutions to some hairy problems, I have come to realize that the most interesting charter I've ever been a part of is growing and nurturing a technical team. I love it and it has been some of the most rewarding work I've done to date. Especially when you have to break down the barrier of physical location.

In my experience, caring for remote engineers requires being critical of their time and time zones, providing technically adequate hardware and network setup and, most importantly, the ability to build rapport through intentional relationships. This includes finding and gradually increasing the comfort level with each engineer over time so that you get high fidelity information that is typically lost in translation via video or slack conversations. It also puts a heavy burden on written communication like pull requests and meeting minutes.

I apologize, I tried to keep this short and I've cut so much out in an effort to communicate the 'tip of the iceberg' while respecting your time. I believe in what Aula is building and I know I would provide the value that Aula is looking for in a VP of Engineering. I would also really like working for a place that writes job descriptions like yours.

Thank you for your time,

Jim
