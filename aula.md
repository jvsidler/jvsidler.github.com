Hello Aula!
===========

I'm Jim Sidler, VP of Engineering at Aula.

* * *

I know that might be incredibly audacious and I know you are very busy so I will keep this concise. I have already applied to the position via remoteok.io but I haven't been able to shake the feeling that I am the perfect fit for the role and really want to stand out from the crowd. The top three reasons that I will help Aula excel are my ability to foster community, my deep technical background and my experience being remote.

My ability to foster community is comprised of three complimentary skills that are all at play on different levels at any given time. First is my emotional aptitude to read and care about people. In every company I have been a part of, my ability to drum up camaraderie and grow the culture is due to my ability to empathize with engineers of all levels. Recently I participated in an engineering-wide personality test exercise where everyone took the DiSC test. I was the only one to get the 'i' result and everyone laughed because it clarified for everyone why I stood out as the obvious builder of the community. Second is my curiosity toward new tech and then finding a specific engineer that will resonate with it. Part of how I learn is to think through new things out loud with a friend and I've come to realize this naturally brings people together and keeps us all relevant. I suppose the third ability I have combines the first two mentioned, in a way, as I love collaborative environments. I believe that is when you reach the best possible outcome.

I've always liked puzzles and brain teasers because I love to use my brain. This has come in really handy as an engineer over the past 15 years, even as I have built a couple of community oriented software solutions myself! However, as I have been a part of teams that have come up with solutions to some hairy problems, I have come to realize that the most interesting charter I've ever been a part of is growing and nurturing a technical team. I love it and it has been some of the most rewarding work I've done to date. Especially when you have to break down the barrier of physical location.

Being remote is not as simple as having a conducive tech set up. It entails a whole lot more than keeping time zones in mind as well. Remote workers love their time to crunch through the deep thinking tasks required of engineers but, handled correctly, really do appreciate the video calls and meetings that help keep them informed and involved. In my experience, caring for remote engineers requires being critical of your time and time zones, technically adequate hardware and network setup and, most importantly, the ability to build rapport through intentional relationships. This includes finding and gradually increasing the comfort level with each engineer over time so that you get high fidelity information that is typically lost in translation via video or slack conversations. It also creates a more collaborative environment when each engineer feels well supported by their leadership.

I apologize, I tried to keep this short and I've cut so much out in an effort to communicate the 'tip of the iceberg' while respecting your time. I believe in what Aula is building and I know I would provide the value that Aula is looking for in a VP of Engineering.

Thank you for your time,

Jim
