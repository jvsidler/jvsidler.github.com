I have no delusions of people actually reading this ... ever. I just wanted a place to make a deliberate attempt at commiting more to memory.

Since I am a victim of life like everyone else, this will probably see as much attention as the book I never finished but have always hoped to since the 6th grade.

Please, feast to your hearts content.
