So, I've known about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for a really long time, I just never checked it out.

Well, I finally did and its hotter than Arizona blacktop at high noon. Up until now I've just been hosting a default-style rails 2.3.4 app on a free tier of [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

I love that it is simply hosted at [Github](http://github.com) where I already spend a lot of time anyway and that it uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

Peace out.
